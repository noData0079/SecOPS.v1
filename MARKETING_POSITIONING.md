# TSM99 Strategic Positioning

**Core Narrative**: "Policy-Governed Autonomy"
**Tagline**: The Sovereign Mechanica — Autonomous Security you can actually trust.

## 1. The Problem
Traditional security tools alert too much and act too little. Uncontrolled AI agents act without governance, creating liability.

## 2. The Solution: TSM99
TSM99 is a **Governance Control Plane** that orchestrates autonomous agents. It solves the "Black Box" problem by enforcing:
1.  **Sovereignty**: Humans remain in control.
2.  **Verifiability**: Every action is cryptographically logged.
3.  **Safety**: Hard-coded safety switches (Kill Switch, Rate Limits).

## 3. Product Principles
- **No Agent Can Modify Governance**: The Control Plane is isolated from the Execution Plane.
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: If a policy is ambiguous, the agent blocks execution.
- **Audit-First**: If it happened, it is in the Trust Ledger.

## 4. Target Audience
- **CISOs**: Who need automation but fear loss of control.
- **DevSecOps**: Who are drowning in alerts and need "extra hands".
- **Auditors**: Who need proof of compliance (SOC 2).

## 5. Key Differentiators
