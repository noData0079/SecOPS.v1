# TSM99 SecOps AI Platform - v1.0.1

> *Policy-Governed Autonomy for Security Operations*

## 🎯 WHAT IS TSM99?

**TSM99 is an autonomous AI platform that runs your security operations center while you sleep.**

It's not a chatbot. It's not a dashboard. It's a **closed-loop system** that:

1. **DETECTS** threats across your infrastructure in real-time
2. **DECIDES** the best response using policy-governed reasoning
3. **EXECUTES** automated remediation (with safety rails)
4. **LEARNS** from every outcome to get smarter over time
5. **PROVES** every action in an immutable audit trail

---

## ❓ WHY TSM99?

### The Problem

| Challenge | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| **Alert Fatigue** | SOC teams drown in 10,000+ alerts/day |
| **Slow Response** | Average incident takes 287 days to detect |
| **Skill Shortage** | 3.5M unfilled cybersecurity jobs globally |
| **Manual Toil** | 80% of response is copy-paste from runbooks |
| **No Learning** | Same incidents repeat because nothing learns |

### The Solution

TSM99 replaces the **firefighting loop** with an **autonomous healing loop**:

```
Traditional SOC:          TSM99:
Alert → Human → Action    Alert → AI → Policy → Action → Learn
(hours to days)           (seconds to minutes)
```

## 🔧 THE 5 FEATURES

TSM99 delivers **5 outcomes**. Not 35 modules to manage—just 5 things that work.

### 1️⃣ AUTOPILOT — Self-Healing Infrastructure

> *"Fix it before I even know it's broken."*

| What It Does | How It Works |
|--------------|--------------|
| Auto-restart failed services | Detects failures, applies fixes, verifies recovery |
| Scale pods under pressure | Predicts load, auto-scales before degradation |
| Rollback bad deployments | Detects regressions, reverts to last-known-good |
| Patch vulnerabilities | Applies security patches with rollback capability |

**Single Toggle**: Enable "Autopilot Mode" and walk away.

---

### 2️⃣ DEFENDER — Threat Detection & Response

> *"Hunt threats 24/7, respond in seconds."*

| What It Does | How It Works |
|--------------|--------------|
| Anomaly detection | AI scans logs, metrics, network for deviations |
| Threat correlation | Connects signals across your stack |
| Automated containment | Isolates threats before they spread |
| Red team simulation | Tests your defenses with synthetic attacks |

**Single Toggle**: Enable "Active Defense" for autonomous threat hunting.

---

### 3️⃣ SENTINEL — Governance & Compliance

> *"Every action approved, logged, and provable."*

| What It Does | How It Works |
|--------------|--------------|
| Policy enforcement | AI proposes, policy decides, never the other way |
| Immutable audit trail | Cryptographic proof of every action |
| Kill switch | One-click emergency stop for all autonomy |
| Compliance mapping | SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR control evidence |

**Single Dashboard**: See every decision, why it was made, and its outcome.

---

### 4️⃣ ORACLE — Learning & Intelligence

> *"Gets smarter every incident without retraining."*

| What It Does | How It Works |
|--------------|--------------|
| Outcome scoring | Every action rated 0-100 for effectiveness |
| Memory layers | Remembers what worked, forgets what didn't |
| Confidence tracking | Knows when to act vs. when to ask |
| Predictive readiness | Simulates future incidents to prepare |

**Zero Setup**: Learning happens automatically from day one.

---

### 5️⃣ FORTRESS — Sovereignty & Offline Mode

> *"Your AI, your data, your control. Forever."*

| What It Does | How It Works |
|--------------|--------------|
| Local LLM support | Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp—no cloud APIs |
| Offline operation | Block all outbound traffic, still fully functional |
| Cost control | Budget limits, ROI tracking, emergency cutoff |
| Data residency | All processing stays on your infrastructure |

**One Script**: `./tools/ice-age/setup.sh` for complete sovereignty.
